# Programming exercise:
# Age of maturity

# Please write a program which asks the user for their age. 
# The program should then print out a message based on whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.

# Write your solution here
age = int(input("enter your age: "))
if age>18 or age ==18: 
    print("You are of age!")
else:
    print("You are not of age!")
